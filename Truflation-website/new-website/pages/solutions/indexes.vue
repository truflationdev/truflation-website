                                    <p class=" font-light">Use our personalised inflation calculator to see how increases in the cost of living have affected you in the past year. Inflation is a measure of how prices of goods and services are changing, and it can have a big impact on peopleâ€™s household finances. Every day, Truflation publishes the latest inflation rate which measures the change in the price of the goods and services that every household engages on, compared with the same time the previous year.</p>
                                    <p class=" font-light">Some goods and services contribute more to the overall inflation rate than others and some of the products see a large increase in prices, while others stay more stable, then inflation would be driven by the changing prices in that spending category. So, how the inflation rate affects your household depends on which products you tend to spend your money on. This calculator estimates a personal inflation rate for your household.</p>
